Topicalizer
===========

About
-------

Topicalizer is a suite of text analysis and information extraction tools.

It used to be available under http://www.topicalizer.com . However, I unfortunately don't have any time anymore to properly maintain it, which is why I'm open-sourcing the code for others to learn from and build upon.

Topicalizer was a TurboGears application, which is why the source code contains some stuff that's specific to that particular framework. I've tried to remove most of the boilerplate code, though.
